<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr />

<p>My name is Mekenna Baker, I grew up in Utah, United States, and I graduated high school in 2015. I was fortunate
  enough to be able to spend a few semesters at my local community college, and it was there that I met my sweet
  husband. We have
  now been married for 5 years, and we have a beautiful son. I love spending my days with my family, from hiking in the
  mountains to aquarium trips, we have a lot of fun! In my personal free time, I love to bake, read, play games, and
  learn. Each and every day I aim to improve myself, and get to know myself better, so my family and I can have the
  brightest future. </p>

<p>I started my first job when I was 17, like most do. I worked at a local movie theatre, serving concessions. Starting
  off in a customer facing retail job, I stuck with the same type of jobs, as I had the expierence. As I gradually got
  more and more expierence within the field, I grew comfortable, and frankly a bit bored. In 2021 I started exploring
  different fields, and decided to start learning about data analytics. I completed a MySQL bootcamp through 'Break into
  Tech' and loved it! I was finally doing something different, and I wanted to chase it. My interest in data analytics
  led me to a group that I am currently apart of called 'Tech Moms'. Tech Moms is a class that helps women and mothers
  interested in tech, get into tech. In this group I was introduced to web development, and it sparked my interest
  immediately. Since then, I have started another bootcamp, this time for web development, and work on it constantly,
  when I'm not in tech moms. My husband has been interested in tech for forever, and I'll be the first to admit I never
  thought that tech would be for me, but now, I can't get enough! </p>
