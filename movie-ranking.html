        <h3>The Labyrinth (1986)</h3>
    </li>
    <p>This movie is a classic! While incredibly cheesy, I love David Bowie, and I think this was such a unique idea for
        a film!</p>

    <li>
        <h3>Juno (2007)</h3>
    </li>
    <p>I love this movie so much. Juno (Elliot Page) is so quippy, and holds her head high while navigating a teen
        pregnancy. Despite others opinions, she stands her ground and does a very wonderful thing.</p>

    <li>
        <h3>Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011)</h3>
    </li>
    <p>The best feel good movie. While facing a divorce Cal, (Steve Carell) rediscovers himself, and is trying to
        reconnect with his wife (Julianne Moore) and his three children. </p>
